```
 ðŸ”‘ Brendan Eich is an American computer programmer and technology executive who created JavaScript programming language in 1995 when he was working at Netskape and called it "Livescript"
 ðŸ”‘ Javascript is a run time environment, could be referenced as a language not really a framework per se
 ðŸ”‘ React,angular, node.js is a library
 ðŸ”‘ Script (js,shell script etc) is a set of instructions a program runs during compilation, Scripts are executed line by line by the interpreter
 ðŸ”‘ Ecosystem is constituted of different frameworks and libraries.. 
 ðŸ”‘ JS can be used to build everything from mobile android apps to web apps!
 ðŸ”‘ JS is based on JRE (javascript run time engine), releases controlled by ecma script org
 ðŸ”‘ JS ws only used by browsers initially until node.js was released
 ðŸ”‘ js was initially only a interpreted (line by line compilation, faster but less optimized) language but now its a compiled (slower, more optimized, compiles snippet of code by converting it to bits) language too ==> Basically js is JIT (just in time) compiled
